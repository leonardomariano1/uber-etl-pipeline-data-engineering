# Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Uber Data Analytics project, a modern data engineering endeavor that delves into Uber data using a diverse set of tools and technologies. We leverage Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Python, Compute Instances, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio to extract valuable insights from this dataset.

## Dataset Used

We are working with the TLC Trip Record Data, encompassing trip records from both yellow and green taxis. This dataset includes essential fields such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, distances, fares, rate types, payment methods, and passenger counts reported by drivers.

You can access the dataset used in this project [here](https://github.com/darshilparmar/uber-etl-pipeline-data-engineering-project/blob/main/data/uber_data.csv).
